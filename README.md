# Face-Aging-using-Cycle-GAN

# Project Overview

This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create realistic simulations of human facial aging. By transforming input images, it can depict age progression while retaining the subject’s unique features. This technology is valuable in fields like entertainment, forensic analysis, cosmetic research, and scientific studies.

# Business Objective

- The primary goal is to realistically simulate facial aging while preserving individual characteristics:

  - Maximize: The realism and accuracy of aging simulations to reflect true facial changes over time.

  - Minimize: Distortion or loss of facial features, ensuring each transformation remains true to the person’s identity.
